Bring Your Own Code
===================

Our regular python code klatch
------------------------------

I suggest to create a new directory with a dedicated `README.md` and (if needed) the scripts of each session.

You can use `git` to clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/HerrMuellerluedenscheid/byoc.git

After that you can update the content from inside that directory:

    git pull origin master

We can use [git issues](https://github.com/HerrMuellerluedenscheid/byoc/issues) to organize our next sessions. If you would like to suggest a new topic, something you don't understand or a code snippet you would like to discuss hit the __New issue__ button. You can upvote issues that you think are more important: Click the smiley and select the emoticon which expresses your thoughts and feelings about that issue the best.

I proposed two topics but would be glad to see more suggestions showing up.
